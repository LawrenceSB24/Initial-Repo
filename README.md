# Initial-Repo
text-to-text
<!-- This is an intial repo that will contain a basic message and (hopefully) translate the changes to the README file in GitHub -->

<!-- Ok, so based on the initial lesson from Monday, these changes will be made using the following commands below  

1. git clone
2. git status 
3. git add
4. git commit
5. git push

1. git clone: allows you to clone any repo you have in Github into git bash so you can code into it

2. git status: Disiplays the current status of the directory you are working with and its staging area

3. git add: adds the directory into your local repo

4. git commit: allows you to put changes into your repo

5. git push: pushes changes into your github repo
